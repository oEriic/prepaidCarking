1. have mysql downloaded on your computer
2. finish installing and all
3. open mysql workbench
4. from the menus on the top find SERVER tab (I believe)
5. click on data import
6. click on import from self-contained file and find and click on the file you want to import
7. go to default target schema and check on the schema you want the database stored in
8. click start import (it might be hidden at the bottom where you would have to make the bottom tab small)
9. close out on the mysql workbench and reload it to check if the database is there
10. go to dbconnect.php file and edit the $pass to your password and $db to the schema name you put the database in
11. run the login.php by using yourname (all undercase) as the username and last time (all undercase) as password to test if working
